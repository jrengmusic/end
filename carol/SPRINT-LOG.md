## Sprint 18: Menu font sizing, popup scaling fix

**Date:** 2026-04-02

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — diagnosis, plan design, delegation, research coordination
- Pathfinder (x3) — LookAndFeel code discovery, BackgroundBlur caller search, popup scaling investigation
- Researcher (x2) — Mac NSWindow corner radius approaches, NSView tint layer over NSVisualEffectView
- Librarian (x2) — JUCE Font scaling on retina displays, JUCE popup menu text rendering architecture
- Engineer (x6) — NSVisualEffectView + cornerRadius implementation, CGS restore, font sizing fixes, tabFontRatio iterations, revert
- Auditor — verified blur path and font changes

### Files Modified (3 total)
- `Source/config/Config.cpp:146` — `tabSize` default 24.0 → 12.0 (was bar height, now font size)
- `Source/component/LookAndFeel.h:109-110,202,210` — added `shouldPopupMenuScaleWithTargetComponent` override (returns false); added `tabFontRatio { 0.5f }` constant; updated `getTabBarHeight` doc
- `Source/component/LookAndFeel.cpp:98-105,117-125,265-271` — `getTabButtonFont` uses `tabSize` directly; `getTabBarHeight` computes bar from font height / tabFontRatio; `getPopupMenuFont` uses `tabSize` directly

### Alignment Check
- [x] BLESSED principles followed — SSOT (tabSize is single source for font size, bar height derived), Explicit (tabFontRatio named constant, no magic 0.5 multiplier), Lean (no extra helpers)
- [x] NAMES.md adhered — `tabFontRatio` (noun, describes relationship), `tabSize` semantic meaning corrected (font size, not bar height)
- [x] MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no new patterns, existing LookAndFeel override mechanism used

### Problems Solved
- **Menu font doubled on retina:** `shouldPopupMenuScaleWithTargetComponent` defaulted to `true`, causing JUCE to scale popup menus with the target component's display scale factor. Override returns `false`.
- **Menu font too large:** `getPopupMenuFont()` used raw `tabSize` (24pt bar height) as font size. Fixed: `tabSize` is now a font size (default 12pt). Both `getTabButtonFont` and `getPopupMenuFont` use it directly.
- **Tab bar height hack:** `getTabButtonFont` used `0.5 * getTabBarHeight()` to derive font size from bar height. Inverted: `tabSize` is the font size, `getTabBarHeight` derives bar height as `font.getHeight() / tabFontRatio`.
- **Mac popup rounded corners:** Investigated NSVisualEffectView + maskImage approach. NSVisualEffectView as subview of JUCE contentView breaks text rendering (layer tree rebuild disrupts compositor). CGS blur has no corner radius API. Deferred — requires NSVisualEffectView as contentView (view hierarchy swap) which is invasive for a separate sprint.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Mac popup menu has no rounded corners. NSVisualEffectView as contentView (with JUCE view re-parented as subview) is the correct approach but requires careful JUCE view hierarchy management. Separate sprint.
- Mac opacity binary feel — still unaddressed. Separate sprint.
- Pre-existing: early returns in `jreng_background_blur.mm`.
- `LookAndFeel.h` has line ending issues (mixed CRLF) — normalize in a cleanup pass.

## Sprint 17: Config fixes — version placeholder, glass hot reload

**Date:** 2026-04-02

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — diagnosis of 3 issues, plan design, delegation, revert coordination
- Pathfinder (x2) — Config system discovery, BackgroundBlur caller enumeration
- Engineer (x5) — default_end.lua fix, glass API iterations, revert, final setGlass implementation
- Auditor — verified glass changes (reported 4 findings: C1 early returns, M1 null-check, M2 isBlurApplied flag)

### Files Modified (4 total)
- `Source/config/default_end.lua:13` — `%versionString%` → `%%versionString%%` (single percent never matched `replaceholder()` which uses double percent)
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_window.h:68-75` — renamed `setGlassEnabled(bool)` → `setGlass(bool, Colour, float, float)` with updated doc block
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_window.cpp:73-94,108-115` — `setGlass` updates members then applies blur; `handleAsyncUpdate` calls `setGlass` with stored values
- `Source/Main.cpp:141-144,155-158` — Windows init and reload callback pass fresh config values to `setGlass`

### Alignment Check
- [x] BLESSED principles followed — SSOT (glass params set in one function, no shadow state), Explicit (all params visible in `setGlass` signature), Encapsulation (GlassWindow owns its config, callers tell don't ask)
- [x] NAMES.md adhered — `setGlass` (verb, sets properties), not `setGlassEnabled` (was lying about scope)
- [x] MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no new patterns invented, same `BackgroundBlur::enable()` path for creation and reload

### Problems Solved
- **Version placeholder:** `default_end.lua` line 13 used single `%versionString%` but `replaceholder()` wraps with `%%`. Never matched. Fixed to `%%versionString%%`.
- **Glass hot reload:** `GlassWindow` baked colour/opacity/blur at construction. Reload called `setGlassEnabled(true)` with stale values. Fix: `setGlass` takes all params, updates members, then applies. Same function for creation and reload.
- **API rename:** `setGlassEnabled` implied a simple toggle but actually sets window properties. Renamed to `setGlass` to match actual responsibility.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Mac opacity binary feel (issue 3) — not addressed this sprint. Requires research into `NSWindow setAlphaValue` vs `setBackgroundColor` alpha compositing model with CGS blur. Separate sprint.
- Pre-existing: early returns in `jreng_background_blur.mm` (enable, applyBackgroundBlur, applyNSVisualEffect, enableWindowTransparency). Auditor flagged as C1.

### Lessons
- COUNSELOR violated role boundaries by writing code directly instead of delegating to @Engineer. Wasted multiple iterations on opacity compositing model (Option A/B) without proper research. Should have invoked @Librarian for NSWindow alpha compositing behavior before attempting implementation. Trying to fix all 3 issues simultaneously created cascading failures — should have shipped issue 1+2 first, researched issue 3 separately.

## Sprint 16: Fix mac build — freetype include path

**Date:** 2026-04-02

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — diagnosis, fix applied
- Pathfinder (x3) — freetype directory structure, git history, tracked files

### Files Modified (1 total)
- `modules/jreng_freetype/jreng_freetype.cpp:47-54` — removed nonexistent platform-specific `builds/` includes, replaced with generic `src/base/ftsystem.c` and `src/base/ftdebug.c`

### Alignment Check
- [x] BLESSED principles followed
- [x] NAMES.md adhered
- [x] MANIFESTO.md principles applied

### Problems Solved
- Mac build failed: `freetype/builds/unix/ftsystem.c` not found. The `builds/` directory was never vendored. Replaced platform-branched includes with generic ANSI implementations already present in tree.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- None

### Lessons
- COUNSELOR violated "never second-guess ARCHITECT" by questioning Windows build status instead of trusting ARCHITECT's observation and applying the fix immediately. Wasted tokens on unnecessary investigation.

## Sprint 15: App-level modal handling, Whelmed selection, shared Cursor

**Date:** 2026-04-01 — 2026-04-02

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — SPEC-MODAL.md authorship, architecture planning, execution coordination, bug triage, all delegation
- Pathfinder (x6) — keyboard handling architecture, StatusBarOverlay data flow, Whelmed component architecture, Terminal cursor system, focus chain tracing, pane switching mechanism
- Oracle — TextBlock line-navigation API design (5-method minimal surface)
- Librarian — Windows/Whelmed config patterns, default_whelmed.lua structure
- Engineer (x10) — enum move + AppState facade, StatusBarOverlay rewire, Whelmed InputHandler, selection rendering, cursor rendering, mouse selection, focus fix, PaneComponent lift, cursor-always revert to modal, Cursor static functions
- Auditor (x3) — Phase 1 include chain validation, Phase 1+2 comprehensive audit, full sprint audit (29 findings)

- `Source/component/Tabs.h:157` — added getActivePane(); removed getActiveWhelmed (dead code)
- `Source/component/Tabs.cpp:308-339` — hasSelection/copySelection dispatch via PaneComponent; getActivePane implementation
- `Source/component/Panes.cpp:119-120,175-176` — modal clear on createWhelmed/closeWhelmed; paneType constants

- `Source/whelmed/Block.h` — added virtual getSelectionRects, getText, getTextLength, getGlyphBounds, hitTest, 5 line-nav methods
- `Source/whelmed/TextBlock.h` — override declarations for all Block virtuals
- `Source/whelmed/TextBlock.cpp` — implementations: getSelectionRects (glyph-level), getText, getTextLength, getGlyphBounds, hitTest, getLineCount, getLineForChar, getLineCharRange, getCharForLine, getCharX

- `SPEC.md` — Whelmed selection status updated
- `SPEC-MODAL.md` — new spec document for this sprint

### Alignment Check
- [x] BLESSED principles followed — SSOT (ModalType/SelectionType exclusively in AppState), Explicit (pane type constants, no magic strings), Lean (toggleSelectionType/copyAndClearSelection extracted), Encapsulation (PaneComponent pure virtuals eliminate type inspection), Bound (Cursor lifecycle scoped to Screen)
- [x] NAMES.md adhered — `Cursor` (noun, descriptor), `toggleSelectionType` (verb), `copyAndClearSelection` (verb), `hitTestAt` (verb), `getFirstVisibleBlock` (verb+noun)
- [x] MANIFESTO.md principles applied — zero early returns in all new and refactored code (Auditor verified + Machinist fixed), objects stateless (Cursor is pure data, no history)

### Problems Solved
- **ModalType/SelectionType SSOT:** Moved from Terminal::State atomics to AppState ValueTree. Terminal::State methods now thin facades. Both pane types read/write the same source.
- **StatusBarOverlay pane-agnostic:** Rewired from VBlank polling of Terminal getters to ValueTree listener on AppState TABS subtree. Works for both Terminal and Whelmed without type inspection.
- **Whelmed keyboard selection:** Full vim-style modal selection: prefix+[ enters, h/j/k/l cursor navigation with visual-line awareness and sticky column, v/V toggle visual/line, y copy, Escape exit. Cursor starts at first visible block.
- **Whelmed mouse selection:** Click/drag (visual), double-click (word), triple-click (line). No modal entry — keyboard navigation unaffected.
- **Shared Cursor:** Project-level Cursor struct with 8 static position functions. Both pane types use identical movement logic.
- **PaneComponent contract:** enterSelectionMode, copySelection, hasSelection lifted to base. MainComponent/Tabs dispatch through PaneComponent without type inspection.
- **Terminal selection bleed:** Terminal's onVBlank now guards selection rendering with isActivePane check. Whelmed selection doesn't bleed to Terminal.
- **Focus chain:** Viewport mouse listener forwards all clicks to Whelmed::Component::grabKeyboardFocus. Prefix+hjkl pane switching works bidirectionally.
- **Early returns:** Refactored in Terminal::InputHandler::handleKey, handleModalKey, Whelmed::InputHandler::handleKey, Terminal::Component::keyPressed.
- **DRY:** toggleSelectionType extracts 3 identical toggle blocks. copyAndClearSelection extracts 2 identical copy blocks. SelectionType.h backwards alias eliminated.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Terminal::InputHandler::handleSelectionKey and handleOpenFileKey still contain early returns (pre-existing, not in audit scope — separate sprint)
- Cursor struct static functions are Whelmed-only consumers currently. Terminal refactoring to consume Cursor::moveUp/Down/etc is a future sprint.
- Whelmed::Screen shadow state (selAnchorBlock/Char, selCursorBlock/Char members duplicate ValueTree) — acceptable as render cache, but monitor for drift
- TextBlock line-navigation methods iterate glyphs linearly (O(n) per query) — acceptable for document sizes but could cache line boundaries if profiling shows hot path
- handleCursorMovement (110 lines) and handleSelectionToggle (reduced but still >30 lines after extraction) exceed Lean guideline — further decomposition possible but diminishing returns

## Sprint 14: Windows system font fallback via DirectWrite

**Date:** 2026-04-01

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — root cause analysis (SymbolsNerdFont lacks Arrows block, no system fallback on FreeType path), architecture plan (mirror macOS CTFontCreateForString pattern), vendor terminal research coordination
- Pathfinder (x2) — font fallback chain trace (Registry, shapeFallback, rasterizeToImage pipeline), macOS vs Windows shapeFallback comparison
- Librarian — Windows system font coverage research (Segoe UI Symbol guarantees, DirectWrite IDWriteFontFallback API, IDWriteLocalFontFileLoader pattern)
- Engineer — full implementation: SingleCodepointSource, discoverFallbackFace via DirectWrite MapCharacters, shapeFallback rewrite with cache, destructor/setSize cleanup
- Auditor — verified all COM cleanup paths, no early returns, FT_Face lifecycle, cache correctness, platform guards

### Files Modified (4 total)
- `modules/jreng_graphics/fonts/jreng_typeface.h:592` — updated `GlyphRun::fontHandle` doc (now documents both CTFontRef and FT_Face)
- `modules/jreng_graphics/fonts/jreng_typeface.h:1082-1108` — added `fallbackFontCache` (`std::unordered_map<uint32_t, FT_Face>`) to FreeType section; `discoverFallbackFace` declaration inside `#if JUCE_WINDOWS`
- `modules/jreng_graphics/fonts/jreng_typeface.cpp:155-161,551-558,692-968` — destructor and setSize cache cleanup; `discoverFallbackFace()` implementation (SingleCodepointSource, DWrite factory, MapCharacters, IDWriteLocalFontFileLoader path extraction, FT_New_Face + FT_Set_Char_Size); `#include <dwrite_2.h>` + `#pragma comment(lib, "dwrite.lib")`; fixed QueryInterface early return
- `modules/jreng_graphics/fonts/jreng_typeface_shaping.cpp:237-328` — rewrote `shapeFallback()`: primary face check, fallbackFontCache lookup, discoverFallbackFace discovery (Windows), nullptr sentinel caching, advance from correct face, GlyphRun::fontHandle set to fallback FT_Face
- `DEBT.md:27` — font fallback arrows block marked resolved

### Alignment Check
- [x] BLESSED principles followed — Explicit Encapsulation (DirectWrite discovery encapsulated in discoverFallbackFace, caller just caches result); SSOT (fallbackFontCache is single cache, cleared on setSize); Bound (FT_Face lifetime owned by cache, cleaned in destructor before FT_Done_FreeType)
- [x] NAMES.md adhered — `discoverFallbackFace` (verb, discovers), `SingleCodepointSource` (noun, describes role), `fallbackFontCache` (noun, matches macOS naming)
- [x] MANIFESTO.md principles applied — zero early returns in all new code (Auditor verified); no magic numbers; single return per function

### Problems Solved
- **Arrows block (U+2190-U+21FF) blank on Windows:** Root cause: SymbolsNerdFont lacks the Arrows block, and the FreeType `shapeFallback()` only checked the primary face — no system font substitution. macOS had this via `CTFontCreateForString` but Windows had no equivalent. Fix: `IDWriteFontFallback::MapCharacters` discovers which system font covers a codepoint, `IDWriteLocalFontFileLoader::GetFilePathFromKey` extracts the file path, `FT_New_Face` loads it. Cached per-codepoint with nullptr sentinel for "no font found". Resolves ALL missing Unicode on Windows, not just arrows.
- **QueryInterface early return:** Engineer's `SingleCodepointSource::QueryInterface` had two return statements. Fixed to single return with result variable pattern.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Pre-existing: Windows 10 regression test (needs hardware).
- `rasterizeToImage()` does not consult `fallbackFontCache` — it has its own primary → emoji → nerdFont chain. If a glyph is shaped via system fallback but rasterized without it, there could be a mismatch. Currently works because the renderer passes `fontHandle` through `GlyphRun` → `Font::applyGlyphRun` → `Atlas::rasterizeGlyph(fontHandle)`, bypassing `rasterizeToImage`. Monitor for edge cases.
- Linux has no system font fallback yet (no DirectWrite). `shapeFallback` on Linux still only checks primary face. Could add fontconfig-based fallback in the future.

## Sprint 13: seq 1M performance investigation — ConPTY ceiling confirmed

**Date:** 2026-04-01

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — root cause analysis, plan design, benchmark coordination, DEBT.md update
- Pathfinder (x3) — reader thread drain loop trace (TTY::run, WindowsTTY::read, waitForData), macOS vs Windows read path comparison, TTY shutdown mechanism analysis
- Researcher — Windows Terminal and WezTerm vendor source analysis (ConptyConnection.cpp read loop, WezTerm mux read/parse pipeline)
- Engineer — double-buffer pre-fetch implementation (read() restructure + DRAIN_WAIT_MS constant)
- Auditor — verified double-buffer implementation correctness (all call sites, branches, style, contract)

### Files Modified (1 total)
- `DEBT.md:23` — `seq 1M` performance gap marked resolved with investigation findings

### Alignment Check
- [x] BLESSED principles followed — investigation-only sprint; code changes reverted after benchmarks disproved hypothesis
- [x] NAMES.md adhered — N/A (no persistent code changes)
- [x] MANIFESTO.md principles applied — N/A (no persistent code changes)

### Problems Solved
- **`seq 1M` performance gap diagnosis was wrong.** DEBT.md claimed "reader thread drain loop exits too early" (2m33s vs WT 1m12s). Investigation revealed: (1) those numbers were from different window sizes; (2) at identical window dimensions (4K 125% half-width), END (~54.5s) matches Windows Terminal (~55.6s); (3) both sit at ~45% CPU — IO-bound on ConPTY middleware, not drain loop. Implemented double-buffer pre-fetch with both 3ms and INFINITE drain waits — no improvement in either case, confirming ConPTY is the ceiling. macOS achieves ~97% CPU because direct PTY has no middleware layer.
- **Vendor terminal analysis:** Windows Terminal uses overlapped I/O with INFINITE wait + double-buffering in time (ReadFile issued before processing previous chunk). WezTerm uses blocking synchronous ReadFile + 3ms WSAPoll coalescing. Neither uses IOCP. Both block indefinitely waiting for data — no polling.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Pre-existing: Windows 10 regression test; font fallback arrows block (U+2190-U+21FF).
- The ~45% CPU ceiling on Windows is a ConPTY architectural limitation. No optimization on END's read path can push past it. Future Microsoft ConPTY improvements would benefit END automatically.

## Handoff: Comprehensive Audit Cleanup (Sprint 7-11)

**Context:** COUNSELOR Sprint 12 session
**Date:** 2026-04-01

### Problem
Comprehensive audit of Sprints 7-11 identified 48 findings across 4 dimensions: dead code (12), stale docs (17), SSOT violations (0 critical), refactoring opportunities (19). Most are maintenance debt — no runtime bugs, but LIFESTAR:Lean and LIFESTAR:Findable violations that degrade codebase quality.

### Recommended Solution
Address findings in priority order. Full audit report was generated during Sprint 12 session. Key items by priority:

**Dead Code (HIGH):**
- `Session::getParser()` both overloads — never called (Session.h:247-248, Session.cpp:505-506)
- `Session::hasShellExited()` — never called externally (Session.h:255, Session.cpp:517-525)
- `LinkManager::getHintLinks()` — never called (LinkManager.h:160, LinkManager.cpp:221)
- `TerminalComponent::getGridRows()` / `getGridCols()` — never called (TerminalComponent.h:276,282)
- `#include "Cell.h"` in State.h:63 — orphaned after Sprint 10
- `class State;` forward decl in Grid.h:73 — redundant, full include exists
- 7 dead Screen methods: toggleDebug, isDebugMode, hasNewSnapshot, getCellWidth, getCellHeight, getCellBounds, forEachCell
- `BackgroundBlur::isDwmAvailable()` — returns true unconditionally, never called

**Stale Docs (CRITICAL/HIGH):**
- ARCHITECTURE.md:626 — ModalType enum lists `flashJump`, actual code has `openFile`
- State.h:160-163 — ModalType doxygen lists `flashJump`, missing `openFile`
- ARCHITECTURE.md:55,211,847 — 3 references to nonexistent `CursorComponent.h`
- Grid.h/cpp — 7 references to deleted `state.getScreen()` in doxygen
- State.h:34-51 — ValueTree diagram missing many params
- SPEC.md:96-100 — Keybinding Reorganization described as future, already implemented

**Write-only MODES (MEDIUM):**
- `reverseVideo`, `insertMode`, `applicationKeypad` — written to parameterMap but never read. Either implement the read side or remove dead storage.

**Potential Bug:**
- InputHandler.cpp:127 — `raw.toLowerCase().contains("v") ? 'v' : 'v'` — ternary always returns same value

### Files to Modify
- `Source/terminal/logic/Session.h/cpp` — remove dead methods
- `Source/terminal/selection/LinkManager.h/cpp` — remove getHintLinks
- `Source/component/TerminalComponent.h/cpp` — remove getGridRows/getGridCols
- `Source/terminal/data/State.h/cpp` — fix doxygen, remove Cell.h include
- `Source/terminal/logic/Grid.h/cpp` — remove forward decl, fix doxygen
- `Source/terminal/rendering/Screen.h/cpp` — remove 7 dead methods
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — fix ModalType, CursorComponent references
- `SPEC.md` — update Keybinding section
- `DEBT.md` — remove stale CursorComponent item (already done)
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_background_blur.h/cpp` — remove isDwmAvailable

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero dead methods in Session, LinkManager, TerminalComponent, Screen
- [ ] All doxygen references match actual code (no deleted APIs referenced)
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md ModalType and CursorComponent references corrected
- [ ] Write-only MODES disposition decided by ARCHITECT (implement or remove)
- [ ] InputHandler.cpp:127 ternary investigated and fixed
- [ ] Builds clean on Windows and macOS

### Notes
- The 3 write-only MODES (reverseVideo, insertMode, applicationKeypad) are functional gaps — applications send these sequences but END ignores them. ARCHITECT must decide: implement or remove.
- Early return violations (~25) and large function decomposition (5 functions >100 lines) identified but are lower priority. Can be a separate sprint.
- The audit was conducted at the start of the Sprint 12 session. Some items (CursorComponent debt, enableWindowTransparency) were already resolved during Sprint 12.

## Sprint 12: Grid::Writer facade, cursor responsiveness, BackgroundBlur cleanup

**Date:** 2026-04-01

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — comprehensive audit (Sprints 7-11), cursor lag root cause analysis (two-clock race between VBlank and State timer), Grid::Writer architecture planning, delegated all execution
- Pathfinder — cursor update data flow trace (parameterMap → flush → ValueTree → snapshot), focus tracking trace (focusGained/focusLost vs onVBlank toFront), enableWindowTransparency include chain analysis, Grid method inventory for Writer
- Oracle — Grid-Parser coupling analysis: cataloged all 20+ Grid methods Parser calls, categorized hot/cold/query, evaluated 6 decoupling options (virtual, template, callback, facade, split, status quo), recommended Option D (thin facade)
- Auditor — 4-dimension audit (dead code, stale docs, SSOT violations, refactoring), Grid::Writer migration verification (7 checks all PASS), BackgroundBlur early return verification
- Engineer — State::refresh(), isForegroundProcess guard, Grid::Writer class, Parser migration (6 files), State parameterMap registration (cols/visibleRows/scrollbackUsed), GroundOps struct, scrollback callback, enableWindowTransparency internal guard, BackgroundBlur early return elimination

- `Source/terminal/logic/Parser.cpp` — constructor updated; `grid.getVisibleRows()` → `state.getRawValue<int>(ID::visibleRows)`
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserVT.cpp` — anonymous namespace → `GroundOps` struct with `Cursor` nested type; all `grid.` → `writer.`; geometry reads through `state.getRawValue<int>()`; `setScrollbackCallback` implementation

- `Source/terminal/logic/Session.cpp:158` — `Grid::Writer { grid }` construction; scrollback callback wired to `state.setScrollbackUsed()`
- `Source/component/TerminalComponent.cpp:599` — `session.getState().refresh()` in onVBlank; `juce::Process::isForegroundProcess()` guard on `toFront(true)`
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_background_blur.cpp` — `enableWindowTransparency()` internally guards with `isWindows10()`; `enable()` and `applyDwmGlass()` early returns eliminated (single return per function)
- `DEBT.md` — removed stale CursorComponent item; `enableWindowTransparency` marked resolved; `getTreeMode` naming marked resolved

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — Explicit Encapsulation (Grid::Writer restricts Parser's access surface; enableWindowTransparency decides internally); SSOT (geometry reads through State parameterMap, not Grid); Lean (Writer is ~30 lines of inline passthroughs, zero overhead)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered — `Writer` (noun, nested in Grid); `GroundOps` (noun, describes ground-state operations); `refresh` (verb, signals intent); `Cursor` (noun, lightweight snapshot)
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — APVTS pattern (atomics for reader thread, ValueTree for UI); tell-don't-ask (Writer writes, State reads); no layer violations
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed — zero early returns in all modified/new code; brace init; alternative tokens; Allman braces; `noexcept` preserved

### Problems Solved
- **Cursor sluggish by 1 char:** Two independent clocks — VBlank (display-rate) and State timer (60-120 Hz) — raced. VBlank read cursor from ValueTree before timer flushed atomics. Fix: `State::refresh()` (public) calls `flush()` internally; Component calls `refresh()` in onVBlank before rendering. Atomic exchange makes timer and VBlank idempotent — no fighting.
- **Cursor visible when window unfocused:** `onVBlank` called `toFront(true)` every frame when component lacked focus, re-stealing focus after OS window lost it. `focusGained` reset `cursorFocused = true`, making cursor reappear. Fix: `juce::Process::isForegroundProcess()` guard — only re-grab focus when the OS window is foreground.
- **Parser held Grid& directly (Explicit Encapsulation violation):** Parser had unrestricted access to all Grid methods including message-thread-only methods (resize, extractText, getResizeLock). Fix: `Grid::Writer` facade exposes only the 19 methods Parser needs (cell writes, scroll, erase, dirty tracking). Geometry reads (getCols, getVisibleRows, scrollbackUsed) route through State parameterMap — APVTS pattern, lock-free atomic reads on reader thread.
- **Anonymous namespace in ParserVT.cpp:** Violated coding standard (no blank namespaces). Fix: `GroundOps` struct with 4 static inline methods and nested `Cursor` type.
- **enableWindowTransparency redundant on Win11:** Called from TerminalComponent unconditionally, but on Win11 `applyDwmGlass` already did the same work. Fix: guard lives inside the function (Explicit Encapsulation — caller tells, function decides). No include poisoning.
- **Early returns in BackgroundBlur:** `enable()` and `applyDwmGlass()` had multiple early returns. Fix: restructured to single `return result` per function with nested positive checks.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Comprehensive audit findings (Sprint 7-11) documented but not yet actioned: 12 dead code items, 17 stale doc items, 19 refactoring opportunities. See audit report in session context.
- `scrollbackUsed` initial value: Grid's ring buffer counter is the source of truth at startup. First `scrollRegionUp` via Writer fires the callback and syncs State. Before that, State reads 0. Verify this is acceptable for the startup path.
- `getScrollbackUsed()` remains on Grid (public) for message-thread consumers (TerminalComponent, InputHandler). Only Parser is decoupled via Writer. Full elimination would require those consumers to read from State ValueTree instead.
- Pre-existing: `applyNSVisualEffect` not idempotent on macOS hot reload; GPU probe approach unresolved; `seq 1M` performance gap; font fallback arrows block.

## Sprint 11: cursorVisible SSOT — remove MODES shadow

**Date:** 2026-04-01

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — identified dual-storage SSOT violation, directed fix, root cause analysis of crash (parameterMap.at() throws on missing key)
- Pathfinder — exhaustive cursorVisible audit: all storage locations, all writers, all readers, full chain trace from CSI ?25h through atomic to ValueTree to snapshot

### Files Modified (3 total)
- `Source/terminal/data/State.cpp:211` — deleted `addParam (modesNode, ID::cursorVisible, 1.0f)` — removed MODES shadow PARAM
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserCSI.cpp:976` — deleted `state.setMode (ID::cursorVisible, enable)` — removed MODES write from DECTCEM ?25 handler; `setCursorVisible (scr, enable)` is the sole write
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserVT.cpp:858` — replaced `state.setMode (ID::cursorVisible, true)` with `state.setCursorVisible (normal, true)` in `resetModes()` — writes per-screen slot directly

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — SSOT (single per-screen storage, no shadow); Lean (removed dead storage)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no state shadowing
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed

### Problems Solved
- **cursorVisible dual storage:** `cursorVisible` existed in BOTH MODES subtree and per-screen (NORMAL/ALTERNATE) subtrees. `setCursorVisible` wrote per-screen, `setMode(ID::cursorVisible)` wrote MODES. `isCursorVisible()` read only per-screen. MODES slot was dead storage — written but never read. `resetModes()` wrote only MODES, leaving per-screen stale after soft-reset. Fix: removed MODES PARAM, all writes go through `setCursorVisible` (per-screen).
- **Previous crash root cause identified:** removing the MODES PARAM without removing `setMode(ID::cursorVisible)` callers caused `parameterMap.at("MODES_cursorVisible")` to throw `std::out_of_range` on the reader thread — crash on first CSI ?25h from the shell.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- GPU availability probe deferred — `attachTo` on 1x1 throwaway component causes crash on some configurations. Needs further investigation into JUCE OpenGLContext lifecycle.
- Check all other MODES params for similar shadow patterns — are any MODES values also stored per-screen with divergent read/write paths?

## Sprint 10: Eliminate State atomic getters, rename getTreeMode/getKeyboardFlags

**Date:** 2026-03-31

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — identified architectural violation (State exposing atomic reads as public API, bypassing ValueTree SSOT), directed elimination of all atomic getters, resolved getMode ODR collision
- Pathfinder — exhaustive inventory of all 13 atomic getter methods, all call sites, thread ownership per caller, identified `getMode` duplicate declaration (ODR violation)
- Oracle — brutal assessment of proposed head/scrollbackUsed-to-State refactor (killed it — head must stay with buffer for cell data consistency under resizeLock)
- Engineer — eliminated all atomic getters, created ValueTree getters for cursor/shape/color, converted all Parser callers to getRawValue, converted Grid::bufferForScreen, renamed getTreeMode→getMode + getTreeKeyboardFlags→getKeyboardFlags

### Files Modified (21 total)
- `Source/terminal/data/State.h` — deleted 13 atomic getter declarations (getScreen, getMode atomic, getCursorRow/Col, isCursorVisible, isWrapPending, getScrollTop/Bottom, getCursorShape, getCursorColorR/G/B, getKeyboardFlags(screen)); added 7 ValueTree getters (getCursorRow/Col, isCursorVisible, getCursorShape, getCursorColorR/G/B); renamed getTreeMode→getMode, getTreeKeyboardFlags→getKeyboardFlags; made screenKey/modeKey/buildParamKey public
- `Source/terminal/data/State.cpp` — deleted 13 atomic getter implementations; added getScreenParamInt/getScreenParamFloat helpers + 7 ValueTree getter implementations; deleted getTreeMode/getTreeKeyboardFlags implementations (replaced by renamed getMode/getKeyboardFlags)
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserVT.cpp` — all state.getScreen/getMode/getCursorRow/Col/isWrapPending/getScrollTop calls converted to getRawValue<T>(screenKey/modeKey)
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserCSI.cpp` — same conversions
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserEdit.cpp` — same conversions
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserESC.cpp` — same conversions
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserOps.cpp` — same conversions
- `Source/terminal/logic/Parser.cpp` — same conversions
- `Source/terminal/logic/Grid.cpp` — bufferForScreen() now uses getRawValue<ActiveScreen> for reader thread; added const overload of getResizeLock() for const Grid& holders
- `Source/terminal/logic/GridReflow.cpp` — reflow() cursor reads converted to getRawValue
- `Source/terminal/logic/GridScroll.cpp` — scrollUp() screen read converted to getRawValue
- `Source/terminal/logic/Session.cpp` — getMode→getMode (ValueTree), getKeyboardFlags→getKeyboardFlags (ValueTree)
- `Source/component/MouseHandler.cpp` — getMode→getMode (ValueTree), added ScopedLock to toAbsoluteRow + handleDoubleClick
- `Source/component/TerminalComponent.cpp` — enterSelectionMode uses no-arg getCursorRow/Col; added ScopedLock
- `Source/terminal/rendering/ScreenSnapshot.cpp` — all cursor reads converted to no-arg ValueTree getters
- `Source/terminal/rendering/ScreenRender.cpp` — previousCursorRow uses no-arg getCursorRow
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — getTreeKeyboardFlags references updated to getKeyboardFlags
- `DEBT.md` — stale entries removed (CursorComponent, getTreeMode naming resolved), added Parser→Grid Explicit Encapsulation debt
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_window.cpp` — reverted Windows constructor divergence (both platforms: transparentBlack + setOpaque(false))

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — SSOT (all getters now read ValueTree, atomics are write-only transport); Explicit Encapsulation (State no longer exposes atomic internals, tell-not-ask); Lean (getRawValue is the single raw accessor, APVTS pattern)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered — getMode (was getTreeMode, "Tree" was type encoding), getKeyboardFlags (was getTreeKeyboardFlags)
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no layer violations; State atomic map is internal, never exposed; Parser uses getRawValue (APVTS pattern for reader thread)
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed — zero early returns, brace init, `not`/`and`/`or`, Allman braces

### Problems Solved
- **State atomic getters violated SSOT:** 13 public methods read raw atomics, bypassing ValueTree. Message-thread callers (ScreenSnapshot, TerminalComponent, MouseHandler, Session) read pre-flush values instead of post-flush SSOT. Fix: all named getters now read ValueTree. Parser uses getRawValue<T> directly (APVTS pattern).
- **getMode ODR violation:** Engineer's rename of getTreeMode→getMode created duplicate declaration (atomic at line 518, ValueTree at line 646). Both had identical signatures. Fix: deleted atomic version, kept ValueTree version as THE getMode.
- **getTreeMode/getTreeKeyboardFlags naming:** "Tree" prefix encoded storage type (violated NAMING-CONVENTION Rule 2). Renamed to getMode/getKeyboardFlags after atomic versions were eliminated.
- **GlassWindow white flash on Windows:** Sprint 8 made Windows constructor start opaque (setOpaque(true)), causing visible flash when setGlassEnabled switched to transparent. Fix: reverted to unified path — both platforms start setOpaque(false) + transparentBlack.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- GPU availability probe reverted — `attachTo` during MainComponent constructor causes side effects (flash, state corruption). Needs a different approach: probe timing must be after peer exists but before window visible, with no GL surface side effects.
- Parser still holds Grid& directly (Explicit Encapsulation violation from Sprint 9). Grid::bufferForScreen uses getRawValue internally — acceptable compromise but not ideal per ARCHITECT's tell-not-ask principle.
- `tickCursorBlink` in State.cpp still uses getRawValue internally (line 1076) — this is State reading its own atomics, acceptable.

## Sprint 9: CSI 3J scrollback clear, lock unlocked grid reads

**Date:** 2026-03-31

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — root cause analysis (scrollback duplication via captured PTY logs, DWM timing race eliminated, ring buffer arithmetic verified, threading verified, CC escape sequence flow decoded), plan, directed all execution
- Pathfinder — traced ring buffer architecture (head/scrollbackUsed/physicalRow), identified all unlocked `getScrollbackUsed()`/`scrollbackRow()`/`activeVisibleRow()` call sites (13 total across 4 files)
- Librarian — compared scrollback implementations across kitty, WezTerm, Windows Terminal (data structures, CSI 2J behavior, thread safety patterns)
- Researcher (×2) — researched Ink rendering patterns, CSI 22J adoption, alternate screen spec; decoded CC binary (`LcH` custom renderer, `clearTerminal` sequence: `CSI 2J + CSI 3J + CSI H`, offscreen detection trigger)
- Oracle — brutal assessment of proposed State refactor (correctly killed the approach — head must stay with buffer for cell data consistency)
- Engineer — CSI 3J implementation, ScopedLock wrapping for all unlocked call sites

### Files Modified (7 total)
- `Source/terminal/logic/ParserEdit.cpp:126-134` — separated CSI 2J (case 2) from CSI 3J (case 3); mode 3 now erases visible rows AND calls `grid.clearScrollback()` to reset `scrollbackUsed` to 0
- `Source/terminal/logic/Grid.h:173` — added `clearScrollback() noexcept` declaration; added `getResizeLock() const noexcept` overload (line 136); marked `resizeLock` as `mutable` (line 689)
- `Source/terminal/logic/Grid.cpp:96-99` — `clearScrollback()` implementation: resets `bufferForScreen().scrollbackUsed = 0`; added const overload of `getResizeLock()` (line 68)
- `Source/component/TerminalComponent.cpp:304,777` — added `ScopedLock` to `enterSelectionMode()` and `setScrollOffsetClamped()`
- `Source/component/InputHandler.cpp:82,171,410` — added `ScopedLock` to `handleScrollNav()`, `handleSelectionKey()` (covers lines 171 and 352), `setScrollOffsetClamped()`
- `Source/component/MouseHandler.cpp:102,284` — added `ScopedLock` to `toAbsoluteRow()` and `handleDoubleClick()`
- `Source/terminal/selection/LinkManager.cpp:scan(),scanForHints()` — added `ScopedLock` at entry points covering all `scanViewport()`/`buildPages()` grid reads

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — SSOT (scrollbackUsed written by reader thread, read under resizeLock by all consumers); Explicit Encapsulation (Grid::clearScrollback is a Grid instruction, Parser tells Grid what to do); Lean (minimal change — one new method, lock additions only)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered — `clearScrollback` is verb, consistent with `clearBuffer`
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no layer violations; mutable resizeLock is standard idiom for synchronization primitives in const contexts
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed — zero early returns, brace init, `not`/`and`/`or`, Allman braces

### Problems Solved
- **Scrollback duplication with Claude Code:** CC's custom renderer sends `CSI 2J + CSI 3J + CSI H` during offscreen full resets to wipe scrollback before reprinting. END treated mode 3 identically to mode 2 (erase visible only), ignoring the scrollback clear. Old scrollback persisted, CC reprinted the same conversation, duplicate content appeared in scroll buffer. Confirmed via `script` capture: 3 occurrences of `[2J[3J` in session log matching the "couple of times" duplication observed. Fix: mode 3 now calls `grid.clearScrollback()`.
- **Unlocked grid reads on message thread:** 13 call sites across TerminalComponent, InputHandler, MouseHandler, and LinkManager read `getScrollbackUsed()`, `scrollbackRow()`, or `activeVisibleRow()` without holding `resizeLock` — racing against the reader thread's `scrollUp()` writes. Fix: all call sites now acquire `ScopedLock` on `resizeLock`.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Parser still holds `Grid&` directly (Explicit Encapsulation violation identified during investigation). Parser should not know Grid — discussed but deferred as a larger architectural refactor
- `head` and `scrollbackUsed` remain as plain `int` in `Grid::Buffer` (not in State). Oracle assessment confirmed this is correct — head must be consistent with cell data under the same lock. Moving to State would split head from cells across time domains.
- Sprint 6 debt item "CPU rendering on Windows" resolved in Sprint 8 (GlassWindow glass lifecycle)

## Sprint 8: Fix CPU rendering on Windows, GlassWindow glass lifecycle

**Date:** 2026-03-31

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — root cause analysis (DWM timing race, incomplete accent reset, GlassWindow state model), plan, directed all execution
- Pathfinder — traced full CPU/GPU rendering divergence path, viewport pipeline, DWM glass lifecycle, window opacity chain
- Librarian — JUCE peer creation timing research (synchronous via addToDesktop, not lazy)
- Engineer — GlassWindow rewrite (OS-divergent glass lifecycle), BackgroundBlur rename, disableWindowTransparency accent reset
- Auditor — verified all new code against contracts (1 Critical pre-existing, 0 in new code)

### Files Modified (10 total)
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_window.h` — AsyncUpdater inheritance macOS-only (`#if JUCE_MAC`); removed `blurApplied`, added macOS-only `isBlurApplied` one-shot guard; added `windowColour` member; added `setGlassEnabled (bool)` public API; removed `visibilityChanged`/`handleAsyncUpdate` from Windows path
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_window.cpp` — OS-divergent constructor: Windows starts opaque with real colour, macOS starts transparent; `setGlassEnabled(bool)` stateless instruction (enable/disable blur + opacity); macOS async first-show path preserved with one-shot guard; Windows meta-drag unchanged
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_background_blur.h` — `apply` → `enable`, `disableWindowTransparency` → `disable` (both platforms)
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_background_blur.cpp` — `disable()` now resets DWM accent policy to `ACCENT_DISABLED` via `SetWindowCompositionAttribute`; preserves Win11 rounded corners via `DwmSetWindowAttribute(DWMWCP_ROUND)`; definitions renamed
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_background_blur.mm` — definitions renamed `apply` → `enable`, `disableWindowTransparency` → `disable`; doc comments updated
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_component.h` — doc comment references updated
- `modules/jreng_gui/glass/jreng_glass_component.cpp` — call site renamed
- `Source/Main.cpp` — Windows: calls `setGlassEnabled(isGpu)` synchronously after construction; config reload: calls `setGlassEnabled` on both platforms
- `Source/MainComponent.cpp` — removed `BackgroundBlur::apply/disableWindowTransparency` from `applyConfig()` — glass is GlassWindow's concern, driven by Main.cpp
- `Source/component/Popup.cpp` — call site renamed
- `Source/component/LookAndFeel.cpp` — call site renamed

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — Lean (no state machine, `setGlassEnabled` is stateless instruction); Explicit Encapsulation (glass lifecycle owned by GlassWindow, MainComponent no longer pokes glass APIs); SSOT (`gpu_acceleration` config is single source for glass/renderer decisions)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered — `enable`/`disable` verb pair; `setGlassEnabled` is verb + adjective; `isBlurApplied` is boolean naming convention; `windowColour` is semantic
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no layer violations; module (jreng_gui) has no dependency on app layer (AppState); Main.cpp (app layer) drives glass state
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed — zero early returns in new code, brace init, `not`/`and`/`or`, Allman braces

### Problems Solved
- **CPU rendering blank on Windows:** Root cause was DWM timing race — `handleAsyncUpdate` applied acrylic blur AFTER `disableWindowTransparency` cleanup ran (cleanup posted first, fired first, glass applied second with no further cleanup). Fix: Windows path is synchronous via `setGlassEnabled`, no async race.
- **Incomplete DWM cleanup:** `disableWindowTransparency` only reset DWM margins, left `ACCENT_ENABLE_ACRYLICBLURBEHIND` accent policy active. Fix: `disable()` now resets accent to `ACCENT_DISABLED`.
- **Window lost rounded corners in CPU mode:** `DwmSetWindowAttribute(DWMWCP_ROUND)` was only called inside `applyDwmGlass`. Fix: `disable()` also sets rounded corners on Win11.
- **BackgroundBlur API naming:** `apply`/`disableWindowTransparency` asymmetric pair → `enable`/`disable` symmetric pair.
- **Glass concern leaked into MainComponent:** `applyConfig()` directly called `BackgroundBlur::apply/disable`. Fix: glass lifecycle moved to GlassWindow, driven by Main.cpp via `setGlassEnabled`.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- `LookAndFeel.h` has CRLF→LF line ending changes in the diff (not intentional, git autocrlf artifact)
- Hot reload on macOS: `config.onReload` calls `setGlassEnabled` which calls `BackgroundBlur::enable` — re-applies glass including potential duplicate `NSVisualEffectView`. `applyNSVisualEffect` is not idempotent (adds subview each call). Not a regression (same pre-existing behavior as old `apply` path).
- Sprint 6 debt item resolved: "CPU rendering on Windows — grid is empty" — root cause was DWM glass, not grid dimensions

---

## Sprint 7: Fix copy buffer scroll drift, modal exit on yank

**Date:** 2026-03-31

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — root cause analysis (coordinate space mismatch, modal exit gap), plan, directed execution, applied trivial fix
- Pathfinder — traced full mouse selection → copy → extractText coordinate flow, identified drift root cause
- Engineer — scrollOffset parameter addition, caller updates
- Auditor — verified all 6 call sites updated, no missed callers, backward compatibility confirmed

### Files Modified (4 total)
- `Source/terminal/logic/Grid.h:416,437` — `extractText` and `extractBoxText` declarations: added `int scrollOffset` parameter, updated doc comments
- `Source/terminal/logic/Grid.cpp:720-771,792-826` — both functions use `scrollbackRow(row, scrollOffset)` and `scrollbackGraphemeRow(row, scrollOffset)` instead of `activeVisibleRow(row)` and `activeReadGrapheme(row, col)`
- `Source/component/TerminalComponent.cpp:225,231,237,245,252` — `copySelection()` reads `scrollOffset` from state, passes to all three extract call sites; added `setModalType(none)` so yank from `keyPressed` shortcut exits modal selection
- `Source/component/InputHandler.cpp:287,293,305` — keyboard yank path passes existing `scrollOffset` to all three extract call sites

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — Explicit Encapsulation (scroll offset passed through API, not reached into); SSOT (single coordinate translation point in Grid)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered — `scrollOffset` matches existing parameter naming in `scrollbackRow`/`scrollbackGraphemeRow`
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no layer violations, no new accessors needed
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed — zero early returns, brace init, existing code style preserved

### Problems Solved
- **Copy drifts from visual selection when scrolled back:** `extractText`/`extractBoxText` called `activeVisibleRow(row)` which maps to the live viewport (scrollOffset=0). `screenSelection` coordinates were computed with scroll offset in `onVBlank`. When scrolled back N lines, copied text drifted by exactly N lines. Fix: both functions now take `scrollOffset` and use `scrollbackRow`/`scrollbackGraphemeRow` — when scrollOffset=0, formula is identical to `activeVisibleRow` (backward compatible).
- **Modal selection not exiting after yank:** `keyPressed` intercepts copy key when `screenSelection != nullptr`, calls `copySelection()` and returns before `handleSelectionKey` runs. `copySelection()` cleared `selectionType` and `dragActive` but not `modalType`. Fix: added `setModalType(none)` to `copySelection()`.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- None identified from this sprint

## Sprint 6: Popup fixes, yank from mouse selection, Windows drag-drop fix

**Date:** 2026-03-30

### Agents Participated
- COUNSELOR — root cause analysis (GL context sharing, selection clear, OLE drag-drop), plan, directed all execution
- Pathfinder — typeface cell dimension API, Config Value::Type enum, default_end.lua popup section, AppState cwd API, selection/copy flow, InputHandler key access, CMake definitions
- Librarian — JUCE FileDragAndDropTarget + OpenGL + Windows OLE research
- Engineer — all code changes (GL shared context, cols/rows migration, cwd passthrough, yank wiring, selection clear, JUCE_DLL_BUILD)

### Files Modified (12 total)
- `modules/jreng_opengl/context/jreng_gl_renderer.h` — added `setSharedRenderer (GLRenderer& source)` declaration
- `modules/jreng_opengl/context/jreng_gl_renderer.cpp` — `setSharedRenderer` implementation: wraps `openGLContext.setNativeSharedContext()` for GL texture namespace sharing
- `Source/component/Popup.h` — `show()` signature: `int width, int height, GLRenderer& sharedRenderer`; `ContentView` takes `GLRenderer&`; added `sharedSource` member; `Window` takes `GLRenderer&`; removed stale popupWidth/popupHeight doc refs
- `Source/component/Popup.cpp` — `ContentView` stores `sharedSource` ref, calls `glRenderer.setSharedRenderer (sharedSource)` before `attachTo()`; `show()` receives pixel dimensions directly; `Window` passes `sharedRenderer` through
- `Source/MainComponent.cpp` — `launchPopup` lambda: resolves cols/rows from entry (fallback to global Config), computes pixel size via `typeface.calcMetrics()`, resolves cwd from `appState.getPwd()` when empty
- `Source/config/Config.h` — `PopupEntry`: `float width/height` → `int cols/rows`; Keys: `popupWidth/popupHeight` → `popupCols/popupRows`
- `Source/config/Config.cpp` — `addKey` defaults: `popupCols = 70`, `popupRows = 20` (range 1–640, 1–480); Lua parsing reads `cols`/`rows` as int
- `Source/config/default_end.lua` — popup section: `width`/`height` → `cols`/`rows`; tit example: `cols = 80, rows = 24`; inline docs updated
- `Source/component/InputHandler.h` — added `isSelectionCopyKey (const juce::KeyPress&)` declaration
- `Source/component/InputHandler.cpp` — `isSelectionCopyKey` implementation: checks against `selectionKeys.copy` and `selectionKeys.globalCopy`
- `Source/component/TerminalComponent.cpp` — `keyPressed`: intercepts copy key when mouse selection active; `copySelection()`: added `setSelectionType (none)` to clear State so VBlank doesn't rebuild selection
- `CMakeLists.txt` — `JUCE_DLL_BUILD=1` added then reverted (broke `WebBrowserComponent` private inheritance `operator new`/`delete`)
- `.gitignore` — added `.end/`

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed — Explicit Encapsulation (`setSharedRenderer` hides GL internals; `isSelectionCopyKey` encapsulates key config; orchestrator tells, doesn't ask); SSOT (per-entry cols/rows with global fallback); Lean (minimal API additions)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered — `setSharedRenderer`, `isSelectionCopyKey` are verbs; `sharedSource` is semantic noun
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied — no layer violations, no poking internals
- [x] JRENG-CODING-STANDARD.md followed — zero early returns, brace init, alternative tokens

### Problems Solved
- **Popup text not rendering (GPU mode):** Static `GLuint` atlas handles invalid in popup's separate `juce::OpenGLContext`. Fix: `GLRenderer::setSharedRenderer()` shares GL texture namespace via `setNativeSharedContext()`.
- **Per-popup dimensions ignored:** `Popup::show()` read global fractions, ignoring per-entry values. Fix: MainComponent computes pixel size from entry cols/rows * cell dimensions.
- **Dimension unit changed:** Fractions (0.1–1.0) replaced with cols/rows (integers) — natural unit for terminal popups.
- **Popup cwd inheritance:** Empty `entry.cwd` now resolves to active terminal's cwd via `appState.getPwd()`.
- **Yank from mouse selection:** `y` (and `cmd+c`/`ctrl+c`) now copies mouse-selected text without entering modal mode. `InputHandler::isSelectionCopyKey()` encapsulates key comparison.
- **Selection persists after copy:** `copySelection()` was missing `setSelectionType (none)` — VBlank rebuilt `screenSelection` from stale State params.
- **Windows release drag-drop broken:** Root cause is UAC elevation blocking OLE drops from non-elevated Explorer. `JUCE_DLL_BUILD=1` attempted but reverted — it changes `operator new`/`delete` visibility and breaks `WebBrowserComponent` private inheritance.

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- CPU rendering on Windows — grid is empty (nonEmpty:0), wrong dimensions (46x14 instead of ~87x31). `isRowIncludedInSnapshot` is a CPU-only filter in `updateSnapshot` (Screen.h:870) — GPU always returns true. Investigation incomplete.
- Windows drag-drop only fails when running elevated (UAC). Non-elevated works. No fix applied.
- `Popup.h:13` stale comment: "Content size is computed from Config fractions in show()"
- `setNativeSharedContext` WGL behaviour untested on Windows — popup GL confirmed on Mac only
- CAROL SPRINT-LOG rotated: sprints 122-123 moved to git history

<!-- Sprints 4-6 rotated to git history -->
